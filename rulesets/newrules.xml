    <rule name="ConstructorCallsOverridableMethodRule"
          message="Avoid calls to overridable methods during construction"
          class="net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.ConstructorCallsOverridableMethodRule">
      <description>
      Calling overridable methods during construction poses a risk of invoking methods on an
          incompletely constructed object.  This situation can be difficult to discern.
      It may leave the sub-class unable to construct its superclass or forced to
          replicate the construction process completely within itself, losing the ability to call
      super().  If the default constructor contains a call to an overridable method,
          the subclass may be completely uninstantiable.

          class="net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.AtLeastOneConstructorRule">
      <description>
      Each class should declare at least one constructor.  Note that this rule is the
          opposite of UnnecessaryConstructorRule, so running them at the same time will
          result on a rule violation on every class.
