 <rule name="ExcessiveMethodLength"
       message="Avoid really long methods."
       class="net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.design.LongMethodRule">
   <description>
Excessive Method Length usually means that the method is doing
too much.  There is usually quite a bit of Cut and Paste there
as well.  Try to reduce the method size by creating helper methods,
and removing cut and paste.

Default value is 2.5 sigma greater than the mean.

NOTE:  In version 0.9 and higher, their are three parameters available:
minimum - Minimum Length before reporting.
sigma - Std Deviations away from the mean before reporting.
topscore - The Maximum Number of reports to generate.

At this time, only one can be used at a time.

 <rule name="ExcessiveParameterList"

       class="net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.design.LongParameterListRule">
   <description>
This checks to make sure that the Parameter Lists in the project aren't
getting too long.  If there are long parameter lists, then that is
generally indicative that another object is hiding around there.

Basically, try to group the parameters together.

Default value is 2.5 sigma greater than the mean.

NOTE:  In version 0.9 and higher, their are three parameters available:
minimum - Minimum Length before reporting.
sigma - Std Deviations away from the mean before reporting.
topscore - The Maximum Number of reports to generate.

At this time, only one can be used at a time.

       class="net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.design.LongClassRule">
   <description>
Long Class files are indications that the class may be trying to
do too much.  Try to break it down, and reduce the size to something
managable.

Default value is 2.5 sigma greater than the mean.

NOTE:  In version 0.9 and higher, their are three parameters available:
minimum - Minimum Length before reporting.
sigma - Std Deviations away from the mean before reporting.
topscore - The Maximum Number of reports to generate.
