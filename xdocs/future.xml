  <section name="Future Directions">
   <subsection name="Better symbol analysis">
     <p>Currently PMD only looks at one source file at a time.  Instead, it
     should resolve symbols across classes.  This will eliminate some open
     bugs and enable a lot more rules to be written.  However, it'll taken some doing,
     because it'll require parsing of class files.  Lots of work here.</p>
   </subsection>
      <subsection name="Data flow analysis (DFA)">
          <p>Raik Schroeder is working on a DFA layer so we can write some more complicated rules - stuff like
 common subexpression elimination, loop invariant code motion (and code hoisting), shrink wrapping, and partial redundancy elimination.
              He's going to do something similar to the SymbolFacade - i.e., several visitors
              which will add DataFlow nodes to the AST.  More on this as he makes further progress; seems
              like things are moving forward nicely though.</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Control Flow Graph (CFG)">
          <p>Access to a CFG would let us detect some algebraic simplications.  We could also
          do better dead-code detection.  Again, lots of PhD possibilities here.</p>
