   <subsection name="Better symbol analysis">
     <p>Currently PMD only looks at one source file at a time.  Instead, it
     should resolve symbols across classes.  This will eliminate some open
     bugs and enable a lot more rules to be written.  However, it'll taken some doing,
     because it'll require parsing of class files.  Lots of work here.</p>
   </subsection>
      <subsection name="Data flow analysis (DFA)">
          <p>A good DFA layer would let us write more complicated rules - stuff like
 common subexpression elimination, loop invariant code motion (and code hoisting), shrink wrapping, and partial redundancy elimination.
  The buzzword potential alone is astounding.  This is also a lot of work.  Good thesis material, though!</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Control Flow Graph (CFG)">
          <p>Access to a CFG would let us detect some algebraic simplications.  We could also
          do better dead-code detection.  Again, lots of PhD possibilities here.</p>
