<p>
We are hard at work developing an Online Demo for you to run
your SourceForge project through PMD with the Basic Ruleset.
</p>

<p>
Your project results will be linked off of the PMD website
for a fixed period of time (maybe 1 to 2 days) for you to
peruse the results.  A try before you buy if you will.
</p>

<p>
So watch this space, because the demo is coming quickly!
