   <section name="Copied and pasted code is usually bad">
     <p>But it can be hard to find, especially in a large project.  So we wrote a utility - CPD - to find it for us.
     CPD uses (more or less) Michael Wise's Greedy String Tiling algorithm to find duplicate code.  Here's
     a <a href="screenshot.jpg">screenshot</a> of CPD after running on itself.  Looks like we've got
     some refactoring to do....</p>
     <p>To run CPD as a JNLP application, click <a href="cpd.jnlp">here</a>.</p>
     <p>As a reference point, running the CPD GUI against the JDK 1.4 java.net package on a
     Pentium III with 512 MB of RAM took 6 minutes 22 seconds.  It found some nice duplicates which
     you can see <a href="cpd_java_net_dupes.txt">here</a> - the largest ones are at the bottom of the page.</p>
     <p>Future plans</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Make a PMD rule for CPD</li>
        <li>Make the GUI remember your settings</li>
        <li>Improve the algorithm to make it greedier</li>
        <li>Suggestions?  Post them <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=188192">here</a>.  Thanks!</li>
