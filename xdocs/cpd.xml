   <section name="Copied and pasted code is usually bad">
     <p>But it can be hard to find, especially in a large project.  So we wrote a utility - CPD - to find it for us.
     CPD uses (more or less) Michael Wise's Greedy String Tiling algorithm to find duplicate code.</p>
     <p>Here's a <a href="images/screenshot_cpd.jpg">screenshot</a> of CPD after running on the JDK java.lang package.</p>
     <p>To run CPD as a JNLP application, click <a href="cpd.jnlp">here</a>.</p>
     <p>As a reference point, running the CPD GUI against the JDK 1.4 java packages  (1178 files, 13.4 MB of data)on a
     Celeron 1.13 GHz machine with 256 MB of RAM took 19 hours and 59 minutes.  It found some nice duplicates which
     you can see <a href="cpdresults.txt">here</a> - the largest ones are at the bottom of the page.</p>
     <p>There's also a JavaSpaces version available for splitting the CPD effort across a farm of machines.
     I usually post news on that <a href="http://cpd.jini.org/">here</a> and the releases are <a href="http://sf.net/projects/pmd/">here</a></p>
     <p>Future plans</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Make a PMD rule for CPD</li>
        <li>Make the GUI remember your settings</li>
        <li>Improve the algorithm to make it greedier</li>
        <li>Suggestions?  Post them <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=188192">here</a>.  Thanks!</li>
