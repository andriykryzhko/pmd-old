    <section name="How to write a PMD rule">
<p>
Writing PMD rules is cool because you don't have to wait for us to get around to implementing feature requests.
</p>
    <subsection name="Get a development environment set up first">
    <p>
    In order to do rules, it'll help if you can modify the PMD source.
    So download the latest source release (i.e., pmd-src-0.7.zip or something) and unzip it somewhere on your computer.
    </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection name="Figure out what you want to look for">
    <p>
    Now lets's figure out what problem you want to spot.  Let's use "While loops must use braces" as an example.
    You've seen this before a thousand times so you know what it looks like:
    </p>
    <source>
<![CDATA[
       public class Example {
        public void bar() {
         while (baz)
            buz.doSomething();
        }
       }
]]>
    </source>
    <p>
    So we know what an example in source code looks like, which is half the battle.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Write a test-data example and look at the AST">
    <p>
    PMD doesn't use the source code directly; it uses a JJTree/JavaCC generated parser to parse the source code and
    produce an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).  The AST for the code above looks like this:

    <p>
    You can generate this yourself by:
    <ul>
    <li>Put the example file in the pmd/test-data directory in a file called "Example.java"</li>
    <li>Edit the class <code>net.sourceforge.pmd.PMD</code> and uncomment the line that says <code>c.dump();</code></li>
    <li>Open a command prompt and cd into the pmd/etc directory</li>
    <li>Recompile the project using the Ant task; i.e., <code>ant compile</ant></li>
    <li>Run the <code>go</code> batch file to run PMD on one file, like this: <code>go Example xml rulesets/basic.xml</code>.  The go.bat file
    will fill in the directories and main class and whatnot.
    You'll probably have to edit this batch file to match where you unzipped PMD.</li>
    <li>If you get a ClassNotFoundException, make sure the pmd-?.?.jar file is on your classpath.</li>
    <li>The rulesets need to be on there too - so make sure the pmd directory is on your classpath too.</li>
    <li>If you get a FileNotFoundException, make sure that go.bat is pointing to the test-data directory where you put Example.java</li>
    </ul>
