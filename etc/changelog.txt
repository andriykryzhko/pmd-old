Added a new Ant task for CPD; thanks to Andy Glover for the code.
Added ability to specify a class name as a renderer on the command line or in the formatter "type" attribute of the Ant task.
Brian Ewins completely rewrote CPD using a portion of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform - it's much, much, much faster now.
Rebuilt parser with JavaCC 3.0; made several parser optimizations.
The Ant task now accepts a <classpath> element to aid in loading custom rulesets.  Thanks to Luke Francl for the suggestion.
Fixed bug in UnnecessaryConstructorRule; thanks to Adam Nemeth for the fix.
TODO - fix it so tests and rules don't duplicate the xpath expressions

March 21, 2003 - 1.04

Moved JUnit rules into their own package - "net.sourceforge.pmd.rules.junit".

February 11, 2003 - 1.03
Added new rules: CyclomaticComplexityRule, AssignmentInOperandRule
Added numbering to the HTMLRenderer; thx to Luke Francl for the code.

The Ant task now determines whether the formatter toFile attribute is absolute or relative and routes the report appropriately.
Moved several rules into a new "controversial" ruleset.
Fixed bug 672742 - grammar typo was hosing up ASTConstructorDeclaration which was hosing up UseSingletonRule
Fixed bug 674393 - OnlyOneReturn rule no longer counts returns that are inside anonymous inner classes as being inside the containing method.  Thx to C. Lamont Gilbert for the bug report.

Fixed bug 673662 - The Ant task's "failOnError" attribute works again.  Changed the semantics of this attribute, though, so it fails the build if errors occurred.  A new attribute 'failOnRuleViolation' serves the purpose of stopping the build if rule violations are found.
Fixed bug 676340 - Symbol table now creates new scope level when it encounters a switch statement.  See the bug for code details; generally, this bug would have triggered runtime exceptions on certain blocks of code.
Fixed bug 683465 - JavaCC parser no longer has ability to throw java.lang.Error; now it only throws java.lang.RuntimeExceptions.  Thx to Gunnlaugur Thor Briem for a good discussion on this topic.
Fixed bug in OverrideBothEqualsAndHashcodeRule - it no longer bails out with a NullPtrException on interfaces that declare a method signature "equals(Object)".  Thx to Don Leckie for catching that.
