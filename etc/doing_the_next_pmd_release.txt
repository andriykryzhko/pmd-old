set ANT_HOME=c:\ant
ant dist
ant test
Do all the JUnit tests run?  OK, then:
ant dist

TESTS: Can you
1) run 1 file and get a report
run c:\data\pmd\pmd\test-data\Unused1.java xml rulesets/unusedcode.xml
run c:\data\pmd\pmd\test-data\Unused1.java html rulesets/unusedcode.xml
2) run the Ant 'pmd' task and get a report
ant pmd

Prepare binary release:
rmdir /q /s c:\tmp\pmd
mkdir -p c:\tmp\pmd\etc
mkdir c:\tmp\pmd\lib
copy run.bat c:\tmp\pmd\etc
copy build.xml c:\tmp\pmd\etc
copy cpdgui.bat c:\tmp\pmd\etc
copy ..\lib\pmd-1.0rc2.jar c:\tmp\pmd\lib
copy ..\lib\xmlParserAPIs-2.0.2.jar c:\tmp\pmd\lib
copy ..\lib\xercesImpl-2.0.2.jar c:\tmp\pmd\lib
Zip it up, rename it pmd-bin-1.0rc2.zip

All is well, so time to tag:
cvs ci -m "preps for release"
cd c:\data\pmd
cvs rtag -D tomorrow "pmd_release_1_0rc2" pmd

Prepare source release:
rmdir /q /s c:\tmp\pmd
mkdir c:\tmp\pmd
cvs export -d c:\tmp\pmd -r pmd_release_1_0rc2 pmd
copy pmd\lib\pmd-1.0rc2.jar c:\tmp\pmd\lib
zip it up, rename it to pmd-src-1.0rc2.zip

if you see a bug and fix it, you can delete the release using:
cvs rtag -d pmd_release_1_0rc2 pmd
and then retag everything
