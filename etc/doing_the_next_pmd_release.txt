make sure code is up to date and everything is in svn:

ant clean
svn update
svn status

run version update script at the top level:

./tools/shell/update_version.sh <version>

    tasks implemented by script:
    update pmd.bat, designer.bat, bgastviewer.*, cpd.jnlp, cpdgui.bat, build.xml to point to pmd-<version>.jar
    update PMD.java, xdocs/running.xml, compiling.xml, integrations.xml, installing.xml to reflect pmd-<version>
    update the release date in the changelog
    update release number and tag name in project.xml

then, run the script that will generate the proper rulesets/rulesets.properties

./tools/shell/updating_rulesets.sh rulesets/rulesets.properties
	update rulesets/rulesets.properties - add any new ruleset file names

ensure all the new rules are listed in a rulesets/releases/<version>.xml file

ant recompile regress test

./bin/pmd.sh ~/tmp/Test.java xml unusedcode
./bin/pmd.sh ~/tmp/Test.java html rulesets/unusedcode.xml
