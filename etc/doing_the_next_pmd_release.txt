Prepare binary release:
rmdir /q /s c:\tmp\pmd
mkdir c:\tmp\pmd\etc
mkdir c:\tmp\pmd\lib
copy run.bat c:\tmp\pmd\etc
copy build.xml c:\tmp\pmd\etc
copy cpdgui.bat c:\tmp\pmd\etc
copy readme.txt c:\tmp\pmd\etc
copy changelog.txt c:\tmp\pmd\etc
copy astviewer.sh c:\tmp\pmd\etc

copy ..\lib\xmlParserAPIs-2.0.2.jar c:\tmp\pmd\lib
copy ..\lib\xercesImpl-2.0.2.jar c:\tmp\pmd\lib
copy the docs directory over to c:\tmp\pmd -- how to do this on cmd line?
copy the test-data directory over to c:\tmp\pmd
copy the xslt directory over to c:\tmp\pmd
Zip it up, rename it pmd-bin-1.03.zip

Time to tag:
cvs -q rtag -D tomorrow "pmd_release_1_03" pmd

Prepare source release:
rmdir /q /s c:\tmp\pmd
mkdir c:\tmp\pmd
cvs -q export -d c:\tmp\pmd -r pmd_release_1_03 pmd
copy pmd\lib\pmd-1.03.jar c:\tmp\pmd\lib
copy the docs directory over to c:\tmp\pmd -- how to do this on cmd line?
zip it up, rename it to pmd-src-1.03.zip

if you see a bug and fix it, you can delete the release using:
cvs rtag -d pmd_release_1_03 pmd
and then retag everything
