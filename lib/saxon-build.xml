		<description>
			Re-jar Saxon to only exclude the file which allows Saxon to be the default TransformerFactory.
			The reason to do this is that the open source versio of Saxon we are using is not Schema aware.
			This causes problems for JUnit tests, and perhaps for anyone elese which is using PMD.

		<description>
			Re-jar Saxon to be as small as possible, only including those parts which are needed by PMD.
			PMD only uses Saxon as an XPath engine, not as a full blown XSLT engine.
